B.  Describe the difference between a Queue and a Stack.


    In a queue the last object you add will be dealt with last.
    In a Stack the last object you add will be dealt with first.
    
C.  Write a class for an element doublely-linked list.
    
    
public class EDoubleLinked {

    public EDoubleLinked next;
    
    public EDoubleLinked prev;
    
    public Object z;


    public EDoubleLinked(Object z, EDoubleLinked n, EDoubleLinked p){
    
        this.z = z;
        this.next = n;
        this.prev = p;
        
    }
    
    public void append(EDoubleLinked l){
    
        this.Final().next = l;
        
    }

    public EDoubleLinked Final(){
    
        EDoubleLinked temp = this;
        while(temp.next != null){
        
            temp = temp.next;
            
        }
        
        return temp;
        
    }
